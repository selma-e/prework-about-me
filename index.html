      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello and سلام. I currently work at DocuSign as an SDET. I am very blessed to have received this role with no coding background. So I am pumped to learn all the things I need to become a badass at my job. I also am married and a mother to a 3.5 year old that drives me a little crazy.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am Egyptian American. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cooking, playing with my daughter Mimi, makeup, reading and I want to become a runner one day.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be a Product Manager. I also secretly want to have a cooking show on the Food Network.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Lynnwood, Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a developer because I've always been technically inclined and it's a natural progression for me. I also wanted to make the move to product development in order to see how that side of things works. I've only ever witnessed the frontend. I had reached my limit in technical support roles and needed a new challenge and growth.</p>
